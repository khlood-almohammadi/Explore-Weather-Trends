# Explore-Weather-Trends
In this project, we will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where we live to overall global temperature trends. Instructions  the goal will be to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where we live


# Extract the data :
rom the database. There's a workspace in the previous section that is connected to a database. we’ll need to export the temperature data for the world as well as for the closest big city to where we live. we can find a list of cities and countries in the city_list table. To interact with the database, we'll need to write a SQL query.


   - Write a SQL query to extract the city level data. Export to CSV.
   - Write a SQL query to extract the global data. Export to CSV.

 # Create a line chart
 that compares our city’s temperatures with the global temperatures. Make sure to plot the moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable (the last concept in the previous lesson goes over how to do this in a spreadsheet).


# Make observations 
about the similarities and differences between the world averages and our city’s averages, as well as overall trends. Here are some questions to get we started.

 -  Is our city hotter or cooler on average compared to the global average? Has the difference been consistent over time?
 -  “How do the changes in our city’s temperatures over time compare to the changes in the global average?”
 -  What does the overall trend look like? Is the world getting hotter or cooler? Has the trend been consistent over the last few hundred years?
    
 # Submission


our submission should be a PDF that includes:

An outline of steps taken to prepare the data to be visualized in the chart, such as:
 - What tools did we use for each step? (Python, SQL, Excel, etc)
 - How did we calculate the moving average?
 - What were our key considerations when deciding how to visualize the trends?
 - Line chart with local and global temperature trends
 - At least four observations about the similarities and/or differences in the trends

## 1) In general,We came to the following conclusions


we notice an increasing rise in recorded temperatures, whether at the local or global level, and perhaps one of the reasons for this increase is environmental pollution.

2) Depending on the geographical location, Tokyo has all its four seasons and records moderate temperatures, which makes preparing for tourist trips a good idea.

3) Compared to global ،The average temperature of the Tokyo increases by 3.69 °C in the lower temperature And the difference in high temperatures by 4.32 °C in the highest temperature.

4) Moving averages at the local and global levels are almost constant and have the same slight variations in trends.

5) Important note: In 2004, Tokyo recorded 14.05 °C, the highest temperature in the data, while at the same time global temperatures recorded a decrease of 9.32 °C. Meaning that the temperature increase in Tokyo coincided with a relatively low rate in the rest of the countries, based on the recorded data, with a difference of 4.73 degrees recorded for Tokyo.

After that, Tokyo recorded a drop in temperatures In 2005, it recorded a temperature of 12.99 °C, down 1.06 °C degrees from the previous year 2004, and 3.29 °C higher than the world temperature

6) Finally, I highly recommend visiting Tokyo in the spring or autumn season to enjoy the beautiful scenery, but a little advice do not forget to carry a jacket with you to protect from some cold surprises, especially after sunset.
